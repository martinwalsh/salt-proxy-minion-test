Proxy-minion REST example
=========================

Simple REST endpoint with which to test the Salt Proxy Minion

Requires only Bottle to be installed (`pip install bottle`).

Running `rest.py` will start a simple webserver at http://localhost:8000.  You
can hit that server with a browser to get a page that simulates the
status of a server.

See the documentation for Salt for details of the proxy.
